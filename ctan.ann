newpax allows to insert PDF in a document while preserving
internal and external links. With lualatex it works in the document
directly, other engines require to run a compilaton with lualatex or to call
a lua script first.

The package is based on and uses code from [pax](https://ctan.org/pkg/pax) by Heiko Oberdiek.

It requires the new LaTeX PDF management from the pdfmanagement-testphase package.
